# About
One of the major requirements of modern communication systems is compactness, which has led to miniaturization of antenna size. This has become much easier due to the advent of Microstrip Patch Antennas (MPAs), as they are smaller in size, easy to fabricate and low in cost. These MPAs also eliminate feed radiation and provide high bandwidth. There are different types of feed mechanisms. This work provides a detailed analysis of feeding techniques for Rectangular Microstrip Patch Antenna (RMPA). A microstrip patch antenna is a planar directional antenna in which a metal patch is placed on top of a dielectric substrate which in turn is placed on top of a metal ground plane. The power transfer between a source and antenna is done through a feed line. The feed is used to connect the antenna with the radio transmitter or receiver. So the impedance patch must be matched with the impedance of feed line. To avoid signal reflection which consumes power, impedance must be matched. In general, the characteristic impedance of a transmission line is 50 ohms. By maximum power transfer theorem, the patch antenna should be fed at a point where input impedance is 50 ohms for maximum input power. Various feeding techniques such as Edge feed, Inset feed, coaxial feed and Aperture Coupled Feed were applied to RMPA and impedance matching characteristics were observed. Output parameters like Gain, return loss, VSWR and bandwidth are compared among the feeding techniques. A design rule has also been formulated and presented the performance of the proposed design. Antenna of same dimensions was used to analyze different feed techniques. An approximate formula is introduced to describe the resonance frequency that is then implemented in the design of notch width for inset-fed antennas to achieve better impedance matching. The designed patch antenna is operated at 10 GHz frequency. Rogers RT/duroid 5880 is used as substrate material, which has dielectric constant of 2.2 and height of 0.1588cm. The design of patch antenna was simulated using ANSYS electronics 2022R2 HFSS tool
